**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 main steps. 

Pior to these I imported the relevant packages and defined the parameters. The pipeline calls in the various functions from 'Helper' which defines the main functions for finding houghlines. 

First, I converted the images to grayscale

Then I applied the guassian blur cv2.GaussianBlur()
![alt text][image3]
Applied the canny function. cv2.Canny() applies Gaussian smoothing, suppresses noise and spurious gradients by averaging. It detects strong edges. 
The pixels between the set limits of low_threshold and high_threshold will be included as long as they are connected to strong edges.

Found the region of interest, using a polygon shape. Defined the vertices of a four sided polygon to mask using cv2.fillPoly(). With the origin being in the upper left corner (think of location of a matrix).

cv2.HoughLinesP()
In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

Iterate over the output "lines" and draw lines on a blank image

Finally, the lines were overlayed on the original image.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

The project was fun to work on, it was a jump from the classroom material and the project instructions were somewhat vauge. 

This project was not tested on images/ videos of different sizes â€“ the vertices are static and not actively changing per image/video requirements
Ignore lines with certain gradients (i.e. 0 is ignored, could also ignore lines with gradients that differ from the expected average of slope, >0.5?)


Video is a bit jittery, could

One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to filter out small segments of the lines (length < 40 pixels) as they could be noise

Another potential improvement could be to ...
